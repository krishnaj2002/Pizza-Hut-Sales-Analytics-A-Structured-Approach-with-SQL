# Pizza-Hut-Sales-Analytics-A-Structured-Approach-with-SQL
This project explores a structured pizza sales dataset using SQL to derive actionable business insights. It involves querying and analyzing four key relational tables — orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types — to answer business questions related to revenue, order patterns, product popularity, and performance by category and time.

The analysis covers:

Total orders and revenue

Most ordered pizza types and sizes

Revenue contribution by pizza category

Time-based trends (hourly, daily, cumulative)

Top-performing pizzas by revenue

Advanced insights using window functions and subqueries
